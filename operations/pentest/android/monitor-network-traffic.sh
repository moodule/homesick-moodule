# Create another proxy for the android traffic
# Go to proxy => options => add
# Enter the local ip & a custom port, ie 8081

# Route the traffic through the proxy
# Modify the wifi network and add a proxy

# If you don't trust the apps to follow the proxy rules:
# - do a mitm attach, for example arp spoofing
# - in an emulated android device enable proxying at the virtualization layer

# Export burp's CA certificate
# And push it to the android device
adb push burpca-cert.der /storage/sdcard/Download/burp.crt

# OR download it inside the android device
# AFTER having set the proxy routing, go to http://burpsuite
